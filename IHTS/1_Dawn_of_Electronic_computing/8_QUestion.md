# from 1970 to 1990 there were no web but  there were internet so how people used internet?

# The Internet Before the Web (1970 - 1990)

Before the World Wide Web (WWW) was created in 1991, the internet existed and was primarily used by researchers, military personnel, and academic institutions. Here’s how people used the internet between 1970 and 1990:

## 1. ARPANET (1969 - early 1990s)
- ARPANET was the first network to use packet-switching technology.
- Developed by the U.S. Department of Defense, it connected universities and research institutions.
- It laid the foundation for the modern internet.

## 2. Email (Introduced in 1971)
- Invented by **Ray Tomlinson**.
- Allowed users to send text-based messages between computers.
- Used simple addressing format (e.g., `user@host`).

## 3. Telnet (1970s - 1990s)
- A command-line tool for remotely accessing and controlling computers over a network.
- Users could log into distant machines and execute commands as if they were physically present.

## 4. FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
- Used to transfer files between computers.
- Allowed researchers and institutions to share documents and software.
- Early software downloads relied on FTP servers.

## 5. Usenet (1979 - 1990s)
- A precursor to modern online forums.
- Users could read and post messages in discussion groups (similar to Reddit but text-based).
- Organized into categories known as `newsgroups`.

## 6. Bulletin Board Systems (BBS)
- Users connected through **modems and dial-up** telephone lines.
- Provided access to message boards, file downloads, and early chatrooms.
- Popular among hobbyists and tech enthusiasts.

## 7. Gopher (1991, shortly before the Web)
- A text-based system for retrieving and displaying hierarchical information over the internet.
- Organized information similar to a **menu system**.
- Preceded the web but was quickly overtaken by the WWW.

## Conclusion
While the internet existed before the Web, it was mostly used for communication, research, and file sharing. The **World Wide Web (WWW)**, created by **Tim Berners-Lee in 1991**, introduced **web pages, hyperlinks, and browsers**, making the internet accessible to a wider audience.

# Why Did CERN Create the Web?

## **Background**
Before the **World Wide Web (WWW)**, researchers at CERN and other institutions faced challenges in sharing and accessing scientific information efficiently. Existing methods like **email, FTP, and printed reports** were slow and cumbersome. 

In **1989**, British scientist **Tim Berners-Lee**, working at CERN, proposed the **World Wide Web** as a solution.

## **Reasons CERN Created the Web**

### 1. **Simplifying Information Sharing Among Scientists**
- CERN had thousands of researchers worldwide collaborating on physics experiments.
- They needed a **universal platform** to easily share documents, research papers, and data.
- The web allowed seamless access to information regardless of location.

### 2. **The Hypertext Concept**
- Berners-Lee wanted to use **hypertext** (text with embedded links) to connect documents.
- This allowed users to **navigate between related information effortlessly.**

### 3. **Decentralized Access to Information**
- Research data was stored on different computers, often using different operating systems.
- The web provided a **standardized way** to access and link this data.

### 4. **User-Friendly Navigation**
- Existing systems like **Gopher and FTP** required users to memorize commands.
- The web introduced a **graphical interface** where users could simply click on links.

## **How Was the Web Created?**
- In **1989**, Tim Berners-Lee proposed the World Wide Web.
- In **1990**, he developed:
  - **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** – for structuring web pages.
  - **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** – for communication between computers.
  - **The first web browser** (called **WorldWideWeb**).
  - **The first web server** (running at CERN).

## **Impact of the Web**
- In **1993**, CERN made the web **public and free to use**, leading to rapid global adoption.
- The web became the foundation for modern internet technologies like **websites, search engines, e-commerce, and social media**.

## **Conclusion**
CERN created the web to solve the problem of scientific information sharing, but it ended up **revolutionizing global communication**. Today, the web is an essential part of our daily lives, connecting billions of people worldwide.

# The First Web Server: How CERN Hosted the Web

## **What is a Server?**
A **server** is a computer that stores and delivers data to other computers (clients) over a network. Before the web, servers were already used for tasks like file storage, email, and remote access.

## **Were Servers Invented Before the Web?**
Yes! Servers existed long before the World Wide Web:
- **1960s-1970s:** Mainframe computers acted as servers in early networked systems.
- **1969:** ARPANET (the predecessor of the internet) had host computers that functioned as servers.
- **1970s:** FTP servers were used for file transfer across networks.

## **The First Web Server (1990)**
- The first web server was set up by **Tim Berners-Lee** at **CERN** in **1990**.
- It ran on a **NeXT computer** and used a program called **httpd (HyperText Transfer Protocol Daemon)**.
- The first web page, stored on this server, explained what the web was.
- **Address of the first web server:**
  ```
  http://info.cern.ch
  ```

## **How Did the First Web Server Work?**
- The server stored **HTML documents**.
- A **web browser** sent a request using **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)**.
- The server responded by sending back the requested webpage.

## **Expansion of Web Servers**
- After CERN made the web public in **1993**, more institutions set up **HTTP servers**.
- The first widely adopted web server software was **Apache HTTP Server (1995)**, which remains popular today.

## **Conclusion**
While servers existed long before the web, the **first web server** was created in **1990 at CERN**, marking the beginning of the modern internet. This breakthrough allowed websites to be accessed globally, shaping the web as we know it today.
