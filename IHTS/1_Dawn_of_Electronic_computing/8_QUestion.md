# The Internet Before the Web (1970 - 1990)

Before the World Wide Web (WWW) was created in 1991, the internet existed and was primarily used by researchers, military personnel, and academic institutions. Hereâ€™s how people used the internet between 1970 and 1990:

## 1. ARPANET (1969 - early 1990s)
- ARPANET was the first network to use packet-switching technology.
- Developed by the U.S. Department of Defense, it connected universities and research institutions.
- It laid the foundation for the modern internet.

## 2. Email (Introduced in 1971)
- Invented by **Ray Tomlinson**.
- Allowed users to send text-based messages between computers.
- Used simple addressing format (e.g., `user@host`).

## 3. Telnet (1970s - 1990s)
- A command-line tool for remotely accessing and controlling computers over a network.
- Users could log into distant machines and execute commands as if they were physically present.

## 4. FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
- Used to transfer files between computers.
- Allowed researchers and institutions to share documents and software.
- Early software downloads relied on FTP servers.

## 5. Usenet (1979 - 1990s)
- A precursor to modern online forums.
- Users could read and post messages in discussion groups (similar to Reddit but text-based).
- Organized into categories known as `newsgroups`.

## 6. Bulletin Board Systems (BBS)
- Users connected through **modems and dial-up** telephone lines.
- Provided access to message boards, file downloads, and early chatrooms.
- Popular among hobbyists and tech enthusiasts.

## 7. Gopher (1991, shortly before the Web)
- A text-based system for retrieving and displaying hierarchical information over the internet.
- Organized information similar to a **menu system**.
- Preceded the web but was quickly overtaken by the WWW.

## Conclusion
While the internet existed before the Web, it was mostly used for communication, research, and file sharing. The **World Wide Web (WWW)**, created by **Tim Berners-Lee in 1991**, introduced **web pages, hyperlinks, and browsers**, making the internet accessible to a wider audience.
