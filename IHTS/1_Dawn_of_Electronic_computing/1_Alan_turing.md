Itâ€™s rare that a single genius, work
ing alone, can achieve one great 
breakthrough, let alone several of 
them


historical accounts often remove the 
details of the rich contexts that create 
the necessary preconditions for such 
breakthroughs. But our institutions, 
colleagues, students, and even the 
people we have lunch with form a 
context within which we all operate.


At  Bletchley 
Park he did some of his best work

When Brit
ain declared war on Germany in 1939, 
Turing reported full-time to Bletchley 
Park and began working on breaking 
the various cryptography techniques 
used by Germany during World War II. 
Because the stakes were so high 
for Britain, Bletchley Park was a well
funded operation with more than 
10,000 people working at peak capac
ity, representing a diverse mix of 
mathematicians, engineers, linguists, 
and experts in other fields.

when they worked they knew that they
could save thousands of lives, that generated 
an intensely creative environment.

The decryption 
devices combined mechanical and 
electronic computation, but as the 
war progressed and the cryptog
raphy techniques became more 
sophisticated, the need for faster com
putations pushed scientists from the 
primarily mechanical computations 
of the BOMBE toward the electronic 
computations of the Colossus
