# ARPANET and TCP/IP Timeline

ARPANET and TCP/IP are foundational elements of the modern internet, but their development occurred in stages.

## ARPANET (1969)
- The **Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET)** was established in **1969** by the **U.S. Department of Defense**.
- It was the first packet-switching network and the precursor to the modern internet.
- The first successful message was sent between UCLA and Stanford Research Institute on **October 29, 1969**.

## TCP/IP Development (1970s)
- **1972**: ARPANET was demonstrated publicly, showcasing email as a major application.
- **1973-1974**: Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn developed the **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**.
- **1978**: TCP was split into **TCP and IP (Internet Protocol)**.
- **January 1, 1983**: ARPANET officially switched to **TCP/IP**, marking the birth of the modern internet.

### Clarification
Although ARPANET started in **1969**, TCP/IP was **not** formed in 1972. Instead:
- **1972** was when ARPANET became widely recognized.
- **TCP was conceptualized in 1973 and finalized by 1978**.
- **The full transition to TCP/IP happened in 1983**.

Thus, ARPANET predated TCP/IP, and the protocol evolved later to replace the earlier **Network Control Protocol (NCP)**.
