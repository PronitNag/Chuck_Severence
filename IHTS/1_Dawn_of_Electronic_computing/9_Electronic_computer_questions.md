# Computer Evolution Over The Years

## 1. Hardware Evolution
### (a) Size & Form Factor
- **1940s-1950s:** Pehle ke computers jaise ENIAC ek pura room le lete the aur vacuum tubes use karte the.
- **1960s-1970s:** Vacuum tubes ki jagah transistors aaye, jo chhote aur zyada reliable the.
- **1980s-1990s:** Microprocessors aur integrated circuits ki wajah se personal computers (PCs) aaye.
- **2000s-Present:** Laptops, tablets aur smartphones popular ho gaye.

### (b) Processing Power
- **1940s-1950s:** Bohot slow the, sirf kuch hi calculations per second kar paate the.
- **1960s-1970s:** Mainframes aur supercomputers aaye, jo speed increase karne lage.
- **1980s-1990s:** Intel 8086, 286, 386 aur Pentium processors aaye.
- **2000s-Present:** Multi-core CPUs, GPUs aur quantum computing par research hone lagi.

### (c) Storage & Memory
- **1950s:** Magnetic tapes data storage ke liye use hote the.
- **1960s-1970s:** Floppy disks aur hard drives aaye.
- **1980s-1990s:** CDs, DVDs aur better hard drives aaye.
- **2000s-Present:** SSDs, cloud storage aur NVMe SSDs common ho gaye.
