## What is jQuery?

jQuery is a fast, lightweight, and feature-rich JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML document traversal, event handling, and animation. It provides an easy-to-use API that works across multiple browsers, making web development more efficient.

## Key Features of jQuery

1. **DOM Manipulation**: Easily select, traverse, and manipulate elements in the HTML document.
2. **Event Handling**: Simplifies event binding and handling, such as clicks, keypresses, and form submissions.
3. **AJAX Support**: Enables asynchronous loading of data without refreshing the page.
4. **Animation and Effects**: Built-in methods for creating animations and visual effects.
5. **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Works consistently across different web browsers.
6. **Plugins and Extensions**: Large ecosystem of plugins to extend jQuery's functionality.

## Example: Basic jQuery Usage

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

    <p id="text">Hello, jQuery!</p>

    <script>
        $(document).ready(function() {
            $("#myButton").click(function() {
                $("#text").text("Button Clicked!");
            });
        });
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```
